# **Dummy proposal**

## **Project Overview**
As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, wireless networks remain a primary target for adversaries employing attacks such as **deauthentication, jamming, and Bluetooth exploitation**. Our project introduces a **Wireless Intrusion Detection System (WIDS)** designed to detect and mitigate these attacks in real time through an interactive dashboard.

## **Project Objectives**
The main goal of this project is to develop an efficient **WIDS** capable of identifying and alerting users about wireless threats, specifically:
- **Deauthentication Attacks:** Preventing unauthorized disconnections of devices from Wi-Fi networks.
- **Jamming Attacks:** Detecting interference that disrupts wireless communications.
- **Bluetooth Exploitation:** Monitoring suspicious Bluetooth activities that could indicate potential security breaches.

## **Technical Approach**
Our system consists of:
- **Hardware Components:** Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning modules (such as ESP8266, ESP32, NEO-M6 GPS, or SDR-based detection).
- **Software Components:**
  - Python-based detection algorithms for analyzing wireless signals.
  - A **real-time dashboard** providing insights and alerts on detected threats.
  - Logging and reporting mechanisms for cybersecurity monitoring.
- **Deployment:** The system is designed to be **scalable and portable**, making it suitable for academic, enterprise, and home network security.

## **Significance & Impact**
This project contributes to the field of cybersecurity by:
- Providing a **cost-effective and open-source** WIDS solution.
- Raising awareness of wireless security vulnerabilities.
- Assisting in **penetration testing and defensive security measures**.
- Offering an educational tool for cybersecurity students and researchers.

## **Future Enhancements**
- Integration of **machine learning** for anomaly detection.
- Expanding capabilities to **detect more wireless threats**, including Rogue APs and Evil Twin attacks.
- Automating **countermeasures** such as adaptive frequency hopping for mitigation.

## **Conclusion**
This project represents a practical and innovative approach to enhancing wireless security through a **real-time, user-friendly WIDS dashboard**. It serves as an educational resource and a security tool, addressing critical vulnerabilities in modern wireless networks.
