# Deauth Detection Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The deauth detector was logging "Unknown Unknown Unknown" instead of showing actual target BSSID and SSID information.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Incorrect MAC Address Extraction**: The code was confusing `addr1` and `addr2` in deauth packets
2. **Poor SSID Resolution Logic**: Only using direct SSID mapping without considering BSSID (addr3)
3. **Variable Naming Confusion**: Variables were labeled opposite to their actual content

## Key Problems Found

### In `detector.py` and `enhanced_detector.py`:
```python
# INCORRECT (before fix):
src_mac = pkt[Dot11].addr1  # Labeled as "Attacker BSSID" but actually receiver  
dst_mac = pkt[Dot11].addr2  # Labeled as "Target BSSID" but actually transmitter
```

### 802.11 Deauth Frame Structure:
- `addr1`: Receiver address (device being deauth'd)
- `addr2`: Transmitter address (device sending deauth) 
- `addr3`: BSSID (access point)

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Corrected MAC Address Extraction
```python
# FIXED (after our changes):
receiver_mac = pkt[Dot11].addr1      # Target/victim
transmitter_mac = pkt[Dot11].addr2   # Attacker  
bssid_mac = pkt[Dot11].addr3         # Access Point BSSID
```

### 2. Enhanced SSID Resolution Logic
```python
# Improved SSID mapping with fallback hierarchy:
receiver_ssid = ssid_map.get(receiver_mac, "Unknown")
transmitter_ssid = ssid_map.get(transmitter_mac, "Unknown")
bssid_ssid = ssid_map.get(bssid_mac, "Unknown") if bssid_mac else "Unknown"

# Priority: BSSID SSID > Receiver SSID > Transmitter SSID > Unknown
if bssid_ssid != "Unknown":
    network_ssid = bssid_ssid
    network_bssid = bssid_mac
elif receiver_ssid != "Unknown":
    network_ssid = receiver_ssid  
    network_bssid = receiver_mac
elif transmitter_ssid != "Unknown":
    network_ssid = transmitter_ssid
    network_bssid = transmitter_mac
else:
    network_ssid = "Unknown"
    network_bssid = bssid_mac if bssid_mac else receiver_mac
```

### 3. Improved Logging Output
```python
# Before: "Unknown Unknown Unknown"
# After: Detailed breakdown showing all involved parties

print(f"[!] Deauth: {transmitter_mac} ({transmitter_ssid}) -> {receiver_mac} ({receiver_ssid}) | Network: {network_bssid} ({network_ssid})")
```

## Files Modified
1. `/home/kali/latest/dashboard/detector.py` - Basic deauth detector
2. `/home/kali/latest/dashboard/enhanced_detector.py` - Advanced detector with evil twin detection

## Expected Results
- **Before Fix**: `Unknown Unknown Unknown` in logs
- **After Fix**: `TestNetwork1 AP -> Client | Network: TestNetwork1` 

## Impact
- ✅ Proper identification of attack sources and targets
- ✅ Accurate network identification in deauth attacks  
- ✅ Better threat analysis with real SSID information
- ✅ Clearer security incident reporting

## Testing
Created test script to verify the logic works correctly with various deauth scenarios:
- AP to Client deauth attacks
- Client to AP deauth attacks  
- Mixed known/unknown device scenarios
- Proper fallback when SSID information is unavailable

The fix ensures that when SSIDs are available in the `ssid_map`, they will be properly displayed instead of showing "Unknown Unknown Unknown".
