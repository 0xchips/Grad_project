The Flask application has been significantly improved with:

✅ Enhanced Security - Input validation, sanitization, proper error handling
✅ Better Performance - Connection pooling, caching, monitoring
✅ Improved Maintainability - Better code organization, error handling
✅ Code Quality - Type hints, documentation, consistent patterns
✅ Production Readiness - Logging, configuration management, monitoring

The application is now more secure, performant, and maintainable while
remaining fully backward compatible with existing clients.
